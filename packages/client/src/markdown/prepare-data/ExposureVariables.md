We now use the prepared datasets to derive the data variables that will provide concrete data for the exposure definitions in the causal model.

For each of the exposure definitions you have specified, consider how to process the uploaded data in ways that allow you to assign a binary value to each subject identifier:

- 1 if the subject belongs to the “exposed” group
- 0 if the subject belongs to the “unexposed” group.
