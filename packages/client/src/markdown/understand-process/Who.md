The process used to obtain causal effect estimates from observational data is called causal inference. ShowWhy aims to help domain experts develop real-world evidence in an interactive and guided way that assumes no prior expertise in either causal inference or data science.​

This kind of “democratization” of data activities has already been successful in the area of Business Intelligence, enabling users who are not data scientists to view, explore, and make sense of data for the first time. By allowing users to “drill down” into datasets based on the joint distributions of data attributes, these tools can help them to see patterns of association that would otherwise remain hidden.​

However, such associations only show correlation, not causation. Treating the resulting observations as insights into how some attributes are “driving” or “influencing” others could be a mistake, and lead to ineffective (or even harmful) decisions about what actions to take in response.​

Tools for causal inference exist, but they are only accessible by skilled data scientists, and only produce valid results under the correct modelling of domain knowledge. ShowWhy only assumes the domain knowledge and otherwise guides the user through the end-to-end process of data preparation, causal inference, and defending the validity of the resulting estimates of effect size.​
