The goal of ShowWhy is to help you answer cause-and-effect questions of the form “Does X cause Y for Z?”, where X, Y, and Z are the exposure, outcome, and population of interest.

In the [interventionist definition](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/causation-mani/) of causality, we say that an event X causes another event Y if we observe a difference in Y’s value after changing X, _keeping everything else constant_.

The gold standard in keeping everything else constant is the randomized controlled trial. Here the cause X (often called the exposure or treatment) is randomized, so whatever other variables might influence the outcome (Y) are balanced across the “treated” group who are exposed to the hypothesized cause (X) and the “untreated” group who are unexposed.

However, it isn’t always practical or ethical to run a randomized controlled trial with actual exposures performed or withheld. In these cases, we can perform a retrospective analysis of observational data that have already been collected. By making assumptions about the data-generating process for the observational data, we can estimate the causal effect of an exposure X in two ways:

1. by conditioning on the right variables to ensure that other factors that might influence the outcome are balanced across the treated and untreated groups;

2. viewing the data as the result of a natural experiment in which nature or other factors arbitrarily determine which individuals are exposed and which are not.

In other words, ShowWhy enables emulation of randomized controlled trials that produce a high standard of real-world evidence.
