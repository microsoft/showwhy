We can refine the casual question in terms of three key concepts, all of which need to be defined in terms of variables either present in or derived from data: Does &lt;exposure&gt; cause &lt;outcome&gt; for &lt;population&gt;?

For now, enter your initial labels and descriptions for each of the elements of your causal question in the boxes to the right. The labels will also be reflected in the header bar above, serving as a persistent reminder of the focus of the project. You can come back to edit these at any time before executing your planned analysis.​ You can also use the Datasets fields to capture the names of potential data sources for defining each element of the causal question.

At this stage, you should also indicate the hypothesized direction of the causal effect – do you expect the exposure to cause the outcome to change in an unknown direction, or in a specific direction (i.e., to strictly increase or decrease)?
