There are likely multiple ways to define an exposure matching your description, for example based on different kinds of observable, measurable, or otherwise knowable events.​

Consider the variety of ways in which you might be able to operationalize your exposure description with one or more alternative exposure definitions. You must specify a primary definition that best represents your exposure for the purpose of analysis, but you may also specify any number of secondary definitions that follow the same spirit as the high-level description.​

Enter labels and descriptions for your primary and secondary exposure definitions in the table to the right. Later in the process, you’ll work towards loading data and deriving variables that map onto these definitions.​

At any point, you can return to this step to view your progress towards exposure definition.
