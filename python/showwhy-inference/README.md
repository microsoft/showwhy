# Introduction

This repository contains the logic for the ShowWhy Inference, to be called by showwhy_backend functions

# Getting Started

## Run locally

You must have [showwhy azure functions](../showwhy-backend/) in place so they can call the code from this folder.

Follow the instructions to [start your docker container here](../../README.md#installation-process)
