Once you have a final specification curve of valid estimates, you can perform a final statistical significance test for your high-level causal question. This test computes the median effect size of all estimates in the final specification curve, and determines how inconsistent this result is with the null hypothesis that the exposure has no causal effect on the outcome. If this null hypothesis is rejected, the answer to the causal question is likely to be yes (assuming all other assumptions are valid).
