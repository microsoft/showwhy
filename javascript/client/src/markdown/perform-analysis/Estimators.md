ShowWhy offers two families of estimators for estimating the size of the causal effect: exposure-assignment and outcome-based estimators.

For each causal estimate, ShowWhy can compute confidence intervals and run a set of refutation tests to assess its robustness against unverified assumptions made during the causal modelling process. Both confidence intervals and additional refutation simulations can increase the level of confidence – or caution – when interpreting results.
