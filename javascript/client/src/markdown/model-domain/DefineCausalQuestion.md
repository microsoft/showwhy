ShowWhy guides you through the process of answering a causal question based on three key variables: For &lt;population&gt;, does &lt;exposure&gt; cause &lt;outcome&gt;?

We can think about such variables at two different levels â€“ as _domain variables_ that describe the real-world phenomena of interest, and as _data variables_ derived from real-world observations.
Causal inference results will not be valid unless all relevant domain variables are captured and represented as data variables.

Here, we focus on the key domain variables and how they might be operationalized as data variables, given access to appropriate datasets.
