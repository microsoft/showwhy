Based on the identified relationships, we can generate a range of candidate causal models with different levels of complexity.

An edge in this context is a directed graph connection (i.e., an arrow) indicating the direction of causal influence between two nodes.

To eliminate the bias inherent in observational data and make valid causal claims, assuming the causal model captures all relevant variables, we need to control for _confounders_ influencing exposure and outcome and _outcome determinants_ influencing the outcome only.
