ShowWhy is not a tool for causal discovery – detecting potential causal relationships consistent with a given dataset. As the user, you should already have a strong understanding of the causal relationships operating in the domain of the data before using the tool.​

Similarly, ShowWhy is not a tool for exploratory analysis of many candidate causal relationships. Rather, ShowWhy uses causal inference to perform confirmatory analysis of a single causal question over a given dataset. As the user, you should already have a sense of the question you would like to ask before using the tool.​

You can enter your causal question in the header above and are encouraged to do so as soon as you are ready. You are also free to refine it throughout the process of preparing your data, modelling the domain, and planning the analysis. You need to input your final question before executing the analysis, however, and the question should not be modified beyond that point.​
