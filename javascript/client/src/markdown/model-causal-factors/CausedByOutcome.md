For each of the candidate causal factors you have identified, consider whether it is potentially caused by the outcome, and if so, how strongly you believe this to be the case.

Consider documenting your prior reasoning about the likely presence or absence of each possible causal relationship. Later, if desired, you can check the consistency of these assumptions against the available data and record if and how the data caused your assumptions to change.
