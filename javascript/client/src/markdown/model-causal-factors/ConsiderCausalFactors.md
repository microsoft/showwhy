Recall that in the interventionist definition of causality, we say that an event X causes another event Y if we observe a difference in Y’s value after changing X, keeping everything else constant.

In a randomized controlled trial, we can keep everything else constant by randomly assigning subjects to the exposed and unexposed group. Such randomization ensures that there is no systematic difference between the two groups.

With real-world observational data, we have no similar guarantee that there is no systematic difference between the exposed and unexposed group. Indeed, there are likely to be substantial differences that affect a subject’s likelihood of exposure and their resulting outcomes. Our task is to model the factors that account such differences (e.g., the impact of age on health, wealth, etc.).

In the table to the right, make a note of any factors that may be relevant and important to the analysis; in other words, anything that may be causally-related to the exposure or outcome (or both). Do not be concerned at this point if you do not have ready access to data on these factors – focus instead on capturing your domain knowledge to the greatest degree possible.
