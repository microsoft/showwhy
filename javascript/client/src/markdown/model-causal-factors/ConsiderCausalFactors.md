Make a note of any other domain variables that may be relevant and important to your analysis. Include anything that may be causally-related to the exposure or outcome (or both). Do not be concerned at this point if you do not have ready access to data on these variables â€“ focus instead on capturing your domain knowledge to the greatest degree possible.

For each of the causally-related variables you have identified, consider whether it is a potential cause of the exposure and/or outcome, and if so, how strongly you believe this to be the case.

Consider documenting your reasoning about the likely presence and strength of each causal relationship in your domain model.
