For each table, select a column to view the distribution of values within it. Remove any columns that have no possible causal relationship with either the exposure or outcome.​

Columns may be related to the causal question in various ways, for example by identifying the subjects of the population (e.g., via a subject ID) or by identifying attributes of these subjects that allow linking to additional relevant variables (e.g., a country identifier column that allows country-level variables to be linked to subjects via their country).​

Any newly identified causal factors, e.g., those related to the specifics of the data collection process rather than the domain more generally, will be integrated into the overall causal model.​
