Upload files containing all of the necessary data to derive the variables of your domain model.

ShowWhy accepts tabular data files in which each row represents a record and each column represents a variable. For standard delimited text files, values in adjacent columns must be separated by a fixed delimiter, e.g., a comma (‘,’) for comma-separated value or CSV format, or a tab (‘\t’) for tab-separated value or TSV format. The first line of the table needs to be a header containing the names of the variables represented in each column.
