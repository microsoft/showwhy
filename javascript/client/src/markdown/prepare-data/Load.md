To answer your question, you need to upload datasets containing all the necessary data to derive multiple candidate definitions of the population, exposure, outcome, and variables of interest.

ShowWhy accepts tabular data in which each row represents a record and each column represents a variable. For standard delimited text files, values in adjacent columns must be separated by a fixed delimiter, e.g., a comma (‘,’) for comma-separated value or CSV format, or a tab (‘\\t’) for tab-separated value or TSV format. The first line of the table needs to be a header containing the names of the variables represented in each column.
