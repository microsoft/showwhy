	inversePropensityWeighting: `Reweigh each sample in the dataset using its inverse propensity score to obtain similar distributions of confounders across the exposed and unexposed groups.`,
	propensityScoreMatching: `For each subject in the exposed group, find the closest subject in the unexposed group (and vice versa) based on their propensity scores to create exposed-unexposed matched pairs.`,
	propensityScoreStratification: `Divide the dataset into a number of strata corresponding to ranges of propensity score values, and estimate the exposure effect for each of these strata.`,
	forestDoublyRobustLearner: `Estimate heterogenous effects of binary or categorical exposures by combining two predictive models: 1) predicting the outcome from the exposure and control variables;
		 2) predicting the exposure from control variables.
		 Unlike the Double Machine Learning, the first model predicts the outcome from both the exposure and the control variables, as opposed to just the control variables. 
		 The estimate is accurate whenever one of the two models is correctly specified, but typically has higher variance compared to Double Machine Learning methods. 
		 The forest version can handle high-dimensional datasets and model a fully flexible, non-linear relationship between effect size and control variables, but may take longer to execute compared to the Linear Doubly Robust Learner.`,
	forestDoubleMachineLearning: `Estimate heterogenous effects of exposures by combining two predictive tasks:
		 1) predicting the outcome from the control variables; 2) predicting the exposure from control variables. 
		 Unlike the Doubly Robust Learners, this method can handle both binary, categorical, and continuous exposure types.
